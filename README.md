# WT-CW2
This project is the assessment for Web technology module CW2. It imitates a simplistic web-application for sharing and looking for recipes with Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality. This project uses Node.js and Express as a stack for backend, Pug templating engine for rendering the UIs. The data about recipes is stored in JSON format. Additionally, middlewares and modules like express-validator (for input validation), mongoose (to connect with json database file), nodemon (to update the app as soon as changes are made) are used for functionality of the application.

To run the app locally, the following dependencies should be installed:
- express
- express-validator
- nodemon
- pug
- mongoose
- axios
"npm start" is the script to start the app using nodemon
